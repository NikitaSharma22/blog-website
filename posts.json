  "content": "<p>We all play little mind games with ourselves every day. These are the tricks our brain pulls without us even noticing. They shape how we think, react, and even how we feel about certain things. Sometimes, they’re harmless, but other times, they can make us overthink or feel stuck.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Confirmation Bias</h2>\n<p>This happens when we only pay attention to things that support what we already believe, and ignore anything that doesn’t.<br><em>Example:</em> If we think we’re bad at something, we’ll remember the times we struggled, but ignore the times we did well. Once we have formed an opinion, it’s hard to see past it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Anchoring Effect</h2>\n<p>This is when we focus too much on the first piece of information we get.<br><em>Example:</em> If we see a jacket for $100 and then find another for $50, we might think the second one is a great deal, even if it’s not. Our brains tend to hold onto that first price and use it as a reference.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Sunk Cost Fallacy</h2>\n<p>This happens when we keep putting time or effort into something just because we’ve already invested in it—even if it’s no longer serving us.<br><em>Example:</em> Finishing a book we’re not enjoying, just because we’ve read most of it already. We feel like we can’t stop, even if it’s not worth our time.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Halo Effect</h2>\n<p>We let one positive thing about someone or something cloud our judgment about everything else.<br><em>Example:</em> If someone is nice or talented at one thing, we assume they’re great at everything else too—even if that’s not true.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Spotlight Effect</h2>\n<p>We think everyone is noticing every little thing we do, when really, most people aren’t paying as much attention as we think.<br>This overestimation of how much people are watching and judging can make us feel nervous or self-conscious for no reason.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Availability Heuristic</h2>\n<p>We judge something based on what we’ve recently seen or heard.<br><em>Example:</em> If we’ve just heard about a plane crash, we might start thinking flying is riskier—even though statistically, flying is safer than driving.</p>\n<p>These mind games shape how we think and act every day. Once we recognize them, we can start to think more clearly and make better decisions.<br>And the best part is, it doesn’t require us to be experts or to overthink it.<br>Sometimes, just being aware of these tricks our minds pull can help us make better decisions and think more clearly.</p>"

  "title": "Insights from Mindset by Carol Dweck",
  "date": "2025-06-02",
  "summary": "Thoughts on how shifting from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset can change the way we learn, grow, and succeed.",
  "content": "<p>I recently read <em>Mindset</em> by Carol Dweck, who explains that it is not just our abilities or talent that lead to success, but the effort we make and the journey we take to achieve it. She also says that success comes from working hard and being open to learning and improving along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Dweck talks about two types of mindsets: fixed and growth.<br>\nPeople with a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> believe that their abilities or talent can’t change—they are just the way they are.<br>\nOn the other hand, people with a <strong>growth mindset</strong> believe that with effort and learning, they can improve and develop their skills over time.</p>\n\n<p>The book is full of examples. One that stuck with me was the story of the rabbit and the tortoise. I asked my little sister about it. She said she'd want to be the rabbit. I explained why the tortoise is the real winner. It’s not about speed. It’s about persistence and never giving up.</p>\n\n<p>Dweck also writes about grades and tests. She says one test can't show everything about a person's abilities.<br>\nIt’s like trying to understand a whole story from just one sentence—when we need to look at the bigger picture.<br>\nThis made me think of the <strong>teacup story</strong>: if your cup is already full, you can’t take in anything new. We need to empty our cups sometimes to make room for new ideas and challenges.</p>\n\n<p>As I read, I realised that I had a strong fixed mindset. But I wanted to change. I wanted to develop a growth mindset.</p>\n\n<p>The book gave me tools to work on my mindset. One suggestion was to <strong>name your fixed mindset</strong>.<br>\nI called mine <em>Red</em>. I am taking Red along on my journey, listening to what she says, and then responding,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I know it’s a bit hard, but we can do this. We don’t have anything to lose.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Changing your mindset is hard and takes time.<br>\nI’m ready to work on it. I’m learning to value the effort and the journey—not just the result.<br>\nI’m seeing effort as part of the process, not as a failure.</p>\n\n<p>Dweck says,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Change can be tough, but I've never heard anyone say it wasn't worth it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m just beginning my journey and still learning, but I’m excited to see how this new mindset will shape who I become.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, the book has provided me with some really useful ideas.<br>\nI’m looking forward to using what I’ve learned and applying it to my life to make positive changes.</p>"

  "content": "<p>Many of us wait for the “right moment” to begin something important. We want our script to be flawless before filming, to master coding before building, or to have every color before painting. We think we’ll start when everything is just right.</p>\n\n<p>But the truth is, the perfect time rarely comes. Life is unpredictable, full of distractions and surprises. If we keep waiting, we might never begin.</p>\n\n<p>The best time to start is now. You can fix the script after filming. You can learn more while building your project. You can paint with the colors you have. Taking the first step matters more than waiting for everything to be ready. Progress comes from doing.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, some things require planning. But most of the time, starting with what you have is better than not starting at all.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve learned this the hard way. Growth doesn’t come from waiting—it comes from action. It’s okay to begin small and imperfect. You’ll improve along the way.</p>\n\n<p>If something matters to you, don’t wait for the perfect day. Start today.

Wanting one last adventure, he dreams of escaping to the Everglades. But when school kids take him home on weekends, he ends up helping them with their worries instead. Through quiet conversations and heartfelt advice, Leo teaches them to accept themselves and break free from the weight of expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The friendships Leo forms are what truly stayed with me. He becomes a safe space for the kids, someone who listens and understands. It’s a beautiful reminder of how powerful kindness and empathy can be—especially when someone just needs to be heard.</p>\n\n<p>The film also gently explores the pressure kids face from parents and schools. While the intentions may be good, they can sometimes feel overwhelming. <em>Leo</em> shows how important it is to give children the freedom to grow on their own terms, with support—not control—guiding them.</p>\n\n<p>With its humor, warmth, and powerful messages, <em>Leo</em> turned out to be an unexpected gem.
